# 4-DOF-2-link-arm-motion-planning
This repository contains MATLAB code for implementing the Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) and Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms for motion planning of a 4-DOF 2-link arm in the presence of a spherical obstacle. The project provides visualization of the robot in various configurations, checks for joint limits and collisions, generates uniformly distributed samples within joint limits, constructs a PRM roadmap, finds a collision-free path using the PRM algorithm, implements the RRT algorithm to find another collision-free path, and applies path smoothing techniques to remove unnecessary waypoints.
